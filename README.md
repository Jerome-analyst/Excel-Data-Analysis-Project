# Excel-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a personal data analysis project where I explored and visualized the sales and profit performance of the fictional company Market Cart using Microsoft Excel. The goal of this project was to apply data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques to gain actionable insights from historical sales data.
